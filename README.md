# Nurser-Terraria
Okay so to see how exactly this was made just download from the release, but please check the code in github and check with the files you downloaded to make sure they're up-to-date.

This mod was made for Nurse mechanics but anywhere using either a config Key or automactically with set Health Threshold.
Since there isn't alot of help with terraria modding (espically with the new preview versions.) for starting dev's like I was this is something to reference on like for example Configs, Config Headers, New DisplayName and Tooltips, Buffs, ModKeybinds, Npc's, Items, Chest Loot(Only in download), Getting Coins either in bank or inventory, and simple math.

Side Note: In the downloaded version of this nurser build there is a thing thats shows how to open links if you ever thought about or needed it.

Orignal Mod: [Nurser](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3234638824)

# Info
Nurser was made just because.
And to allow player to use a nurse NPC type of logic anywhere but with anti-cheating configs, to keep the game more fair. Basically Nurser heals you up all the way back to full health and then
once you've healed nurse taxes you for the amount of health healed, which can be configurable via Mod Settings. The intended use for Nurser Dev-Testing, Project referencing, and General Playing.
Nurser is open-source to the public and will be updated every once in a while, most updates are for bug fixes, but if Nurser has updated in a while is because their will be a big one that won't be updated until it is fully working and finished. This may not mean there won't be any bugs, dev team has two people in it one a programmar one a manager. zThis recent version should work for Tmodloader v2024.4.2.0 and a lil buggy for v2024.3.2.5 previews, because i can't update it for v2024.3.2.5 for some reason.

### Configurations

**Cost Per Health**: This option is adjustable by numbers so you can set the cost yourself, the default is set to 100 or 1 silver coin

Their is math to the coins for example
1. 1 = copper coin
2. 100 = silver coin
3. 10000 = gold coin
4. 1000000 = platinum coin

This is Configurable because I wanted you to feel like you can have full control with this mod

**Debuff Duration**: The Duration in seconds of how long the 'Heart Ache' Debuff lasts, from a range from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.

**Boss Required**: This is to the keep the mod from being more cheaty than it already is, because this would ruin the fun of playing the game (and requested by Maxhax64).

**Health Threshold**: An feauture to enable the player not having to press the Heal Keybind when health reaches a certain percent.

Example could be that player has 500 health and the Threshold is set to 20% it will heal at 150 health.
