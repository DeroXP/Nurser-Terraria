# Nurser-Terraria
Okay so to see how exactly this was made just download from the release, but please check the code in github and check with the files you downloaded to make sure they're up-to-date.

This mod was made for Nurse mechanics but anywhere using either a config Key or automactically with set Health Threshold.
Since there isn't alot of help with terraria modding for starting dev's like I was this is something to reference on like for example Configs, Config Headers, New DisplayName and Tooltips, Buffs, ModKeybinds, Npc's, Items, Chest Loot(Only in download), Getting Coins either in bank or inventory, and simple math.

From Derourn. (I will probably start making tutorials for Terraria Modding)
